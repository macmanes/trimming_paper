For recreating the analyses:

Download the read data: 

wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR797/SRR797058/SRR797058_1.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR797/SRR797058/SRR797058_2.fastq.gz

Download this GIT repo.

To install:

make

To do the subsampling at 10M reads:

./black subsamp10 \
READ1=left.fastq \
READ2=right.fastq

use sumsamp20, subsamp50, etc for subsampling the other datasets. 

To to the analyses, with trimming at Phred=2, for instance

./black TRIM=2 \
READ1=left.fastq \
READ2=right.fastq \
trim10 trin10 pslx10 pep10 map10

If you want to change how the program is run, 


./black TRIM=2 \
MEM=5 \ How much RAM to use
CPU=5 \ how many CPU's to you have
RUN=run \ 3what shall you name the run
BCODES=barcodes.fa \ #name of the barcode file- muse be in same dir as black.mk
MUS := Mus_musculus.GRCm38.71.cdna.all.fa \ #name of the reference- muse be in same dir as black.mk
PFAM := Pfam-AB.hmm.bin \ #name of the Pfam database- muse be in same dir as black.mk
BOWTIECPU=5 \ #How many CPU's for bowtie
EXPRESSCPU=5 \ #How many CPU's for eXpress
READ1=left.fastq \ 
READ2=right.fastq \
